They should only be deviated from when it is impossible to achieve the desired functionality

The manifest should always fully describe the resulting image, the outcome should never depend on settings specified elsewhere
The bootstrapper should always be able to run fully unattended
The bootstrapper should only need as much setup as the manifest requires such as credentials or the path to VirtualBox guest additions (host package dependencies are an exception)

Roll complexity into which tasks are added to the tasklist
Control flow should be directed from the task graph, avoid creating complicated run() functions (if necessary, split up a function into two tasks)
Task classes should be treated as decorated run() functions, they should not have any state
Only add stuff to the BootstrapInformation object when really necessary (avoid clutter)
If a run() function checks whether it should do any work or simply be skipped, consider doing that check in resolve_tasks() instead and remove the task alltogether

Use the manifest-schema to check for allowed settings as long as the checks are simple (fall back to doing the check in python when that solution is considerably less complex)
